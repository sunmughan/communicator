To start Kommunikater, open the command prompt and cd to the directory that you put Kommunikater in.  Then run "npm i" and then run "cd src" and then run "node app.js" Do not include quotation marks.  You can now visit localhost:3000 in your browser to go to Kommunikater, and you can share this with other people, by sharing your public IP on port 3000.  For example, if your public IP is 0.0.0.0, you can send your friend this: http://0.0.0.0:3000 and they can access Kommunikater app through that.  To shut down your Kommunikater, hit ctrl + c in the command prompt window and if it asks "Terminate batch job Y/N" enter Y.  You can also buy a domain name and use nginx reverse proxy to reverse proxy port 3000, and then you can have it so when you go to your domain like example.com it will show Kommunikater directly instead of going to 0.0.0.0:3000
